# Horizon Dataset

The **Horizon Dataset** is an open-sourced, high-quality dataset for evaluating event forecasting systems such as in [Soru and Marshall, 2025](https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICSC64641.2025.00038). It contains 150 structured real-world events across 15 topical domains, each annotated with a factual outcome assessed over time.

## Overview

- **Name**: Horizon Dataset  
- **Format**: JSON  
- **Forecasting Date**: 16 Feb 2024  
- **Fact-checking Date**: 28 Oct 2024  
- **Total Events**: 150  
- **Topics**:
  - Arctic  
  - Artificial Intelligence  
  - Automotive  
  - Blockchain  
  - Climate Change  
  - Cybersecurity  
  - Disinformation  
  - Egypt  
  - Energy  
  - European Union  
  - Geopolitics  
  - Italy  
  - Space  
  - United Kingdom  
  - United States  

## Schema

Each JSON object contains the following fields:

- `"id"`: Unique identifier for the event.  
- `"topic"`: Topic category (see above).  
- `"title"`: A short textual description of the forecasted event.
- `"valid"`: False if the event had happened even before the forecasting date.
- `"outcome"`: Outcome label relative to the forecasting and fact-checking window:  
  - `1` = Event occurred  
  - `-1` = Event did not occur  
  - `0` = Not enough evidence to confirm either  

### Example

```json
        {
            "id": 0,
            "topic": "Italy",
            "title": "Italy hosts a major international summit on AI regulation in Rome",
            "valid": true,
            "outcome": 1
        },
```

## Usage

This dataset is intended for use in:

- Forecast evaluation and benchmarking  
- Long-term reasoning with language models  
- Temporal knowledge extraction  
- Strategic foresight and geopolitical analysis  

There are no usage restrictions.

## Limitations

- The dataset includes a small number of events (150), curated for quality rather than coverage.
- Topics are diverse but do not exhaustively represent all domains or regions.
- Outcome labels reflect available evidence as of 28 Oct 2024 and may not capture long-term developments.
